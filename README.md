# companion-module-matrox-monarch

A [BitFocus Companion](https://bitfocus.io/companion/) module for interacting
with Matrox Monarch stream encoder/recorder devices.

This module supports the following devices:

- Matrox Monarch HD
- Matrox Monarch HDX
- Matrox Monarch LCS
- Datavideo NVS-30

## Supported Actions

- Start encoders/recorders
- Stop encoders/recorders
- LCS: Set Dynamic Output option

## Variables, Feedbacks & Polling

This module supports polling the GetStatus endpoint, and save the response to module-variables and feedbacks. Polling can be set to various options.

## Development

### Mock Monarch

> This mocking stub may not apply to all the different Monarch models.

To enable basic testing without an actual device, there is a basic HTTP server
that mocks out some of the device API. Right now it just responds to every
request with a sample response taken from the device after a "stop encoder"
call. We can add to this in the future to respond appropriately to different
calls.

It uses the device defaults for auth (HTTP basic auth: `admin`/`admin`) and
listens on port 80. Start it (after installing dev dependencies) like so:

```
node mock-monarch.js
```

And you'll see:

```bash
$ node mock-monarch.js
Mock Monarch is listening on 80
Received request: /Monarch/syncconnect/sdk.aspx?command=StartEncoder1
```

### Output of the GetStatus Endpoint

These are the different kind of output that the GetStatus command returns, based on the selected device model

```
